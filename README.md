# bpfprof

#### Acknowledgments

I've added `bpftop` as a remote repository to bpfprof and customized it based
on my requirements. I'm not sure if I messed up any licensing stuff. Please
reach out or raise a PR to fix any license-related issues.

As mentioned earlier, I'm reusing a lot of code from the bpftop project, so
many thanks to its maintainers and contributors.
